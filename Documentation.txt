Code takes in the CSV file and iterates through it row by row, placin the data in two lists (Multiple options available - list of lists and dictionaries)
Set up the Twilio Client with variables for account number and token
Create the twilio call that the TO part pulls the numbers from the numbers list
FROM is my twilio number
URL is some backing music

Use the same index value of the name list to output who the program is calling
Iterate through the list using a for loop. Opted to go this way so that the program would work no matter how big the csv.

PLEASE NOTE - twilio demo account will not call none verified numbers, it rings my number at the start of the loop then it will
throw an error because the other two numbers in the csv are not twilio verified. I have tried the call with my own and someone elses
phone and it calls fine (changed the list values to check).

Did not manage to get twilio to say the greeting. The code at the bottom works for INCOMING calls.
Uses the response and then the primary verbs of say.

Looked into how to send out text to speech but my research and liaisons with some friends leads me to think I would need Flask and a server.
Checked as much documentation as possible and I cannot find how to utilise text to speech on an outgoing call.
I looked into SMS as a way to message the numbers but it is not what the scenario wanted.
